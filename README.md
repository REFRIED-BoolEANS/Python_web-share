# Python_web-share
Easily deployable local network share using web page from flask.

I made this because I needed to share a bit of code with a fresh install on my raspberry pi.  There might be have been an easier or even better way to do this, but oh well.

#How to use it
Put an index.html file in a folder called 'static' in the same directory as this script, then run the script and now you can access the file from any device on your local network.  As a side-note when you put something inside your html file put it in <pfe> </pfe> elements, this is for preformatted text and will keep any line breaks in your text automatically.

#improvments to be made
There are plenty of ways this could be improved if wanted.  A GUI is (almost) always helpful, and having a way to quickly drop files (mp3, mp4, txt, etc) and have them either viewable or downloadable from any other local device would be handy.  One could even go so far as to allow the user to accumulate multiple files which could be accessed in a hierarchical style such as how the Internet Archive shows all the files for something (just a basic list of all available files or folders that are hyperlinks).
